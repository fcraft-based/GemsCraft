Thank you for downloading GemsCraft, a custom Minecraft/ClassiCube server based on fCraft, 800Craft, and LegendCraft.

Special thanks to fragmer, for creating fCraft! Special thanks to Jonty800, GlennMR and LaoTszy for their hard work with
800Craft! Special thanks to DingusBungus and LeChosenOne for their dedication to LegendCraft! 
GemsCraft is a modified version of LegendCraft. 


##Installation 
####(Windows) 

GemsCraft requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1. Your system may already have it
installed, and you can download it from  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49982
Plugins not working? Getting plugin errors?
Go to your plugins folder and right click on all the plugin.dll's. Select unblock for all of them.

####(Linux, Unix, MacOS X)

GemsCraft is currently not available for Linux, Unix, MacOS X.
GemsCraft at one point was available through the use of Mono, or Wine.
I am instead working on a java port of GemsCraft, that will be much easier to setup.
As the developer of GemsCraft, my goal is to make the process a lot easier.
